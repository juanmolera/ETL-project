This is my first project of the Ironhack data analysis bootcamp and it is focused on the analysis of the evolution of prices in a supermarket. To do this, I have started from a historical record of product data between the dates of and I have fed this record with the data of the products that are currently in the supermarket, which I have obtained from scraping their website. Subsequently, both the initial data and the extracted data have been cleaned to achieve a link between them and to be able to generate a MySQL database. Finally, a brief analysis has been carried out based on different data visualization methods from which a set of conclusions have been obtained.
